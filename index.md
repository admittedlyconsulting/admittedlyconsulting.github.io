Are you applying to college or considering applying soon? Our team, recently admitted to top universities, is here to help. Whether you are just beginning your journey or preparing your essays and extracurriculars for submission this year, we’ll guide you through every step of the process with personalized feedback. Unlike many college consultants, we’ve garnered our knowledge from fully engaging in the admissions process. Our sole commitment is to helping you grow and succeed, and we sincerely believe our dedication will reflect in the acceptance letters you will earn in the future. For that reason, we’re excited to offer one-hour advising sessions on anything you’d like help with, ranging from discovering extracurriculars and searching for colleges to crafting your college profile and refining your essays. Our current rate of $80 per hour is less than half of that of most consultants, and includes asynchronous assistance and careful research that we will conduct on your behalf outside of sessions.
