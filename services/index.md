We offer **one hour consulting sessions** in which we may discuss various parts of your application, including (but not limited to) your resume, extracurriculars, courses to take in school, and writing the college application itself. <br/>


# What might we discuss in consulting sessions?

We understand that students in different grades and different points in the college process require very different forms of assistance. Accordingly, we invite you to prepare questions (whether close- or open-ended) and voice your main areas of concern with your application, and we are happy to meet your specific requests as best we can. <br/>

This being said, below we have listed some common areas in which we believe we can help you:
- Writing the application (rising seniors)
  - Brainstorming and revising essays
  - Writing the extracurricular list
  - Using the additional information section
  - Interview advice and preparation
- General consulting (rising juniors and below)
  - Reviewing your resume
  - Discussing which extracurriculars are worthwhile and how can you succeed in them (e.g., school clubs, Olympiad competitions, research and summer programs in science or humanities, volunteering and community service)
  - Optimal courses to take (and is self-studying APs worth it?)
  - Helping to choose colleges to apply to
  - Brainstorming general ideas for your future college essays

Note that we are happy to share our personal experiences and anecdotes with our own college applications.


# Pricing

Currently, we are offering two plans for consulting sessions:
- Consultation with one team member of your choosing **($80 per hour)**
- Consultation with two team members of your choosing **($120 per hour)**

We recommend consulting two members together to obtain a wider perspective on the college application process, however consulting one member may be sufficient if your goals correspond very well to a particular member’s profile and experiences. <br/>

Note that before our consulting sessions, we may ask you to prepare some materials to assist us. For example, we hope you can prepare a resume or some other list of your extracurriculars and awards. Also, if you are a rising senior who has already drafted several essays, we will likely ask you to share your essays with us before the session. <br/>
