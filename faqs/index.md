    <p style="margin-left: 25px;"> Daphne and Ethan are experienced with the U.K. application system, UCAS, and the viva voce required for admission to Oxford, Cambridge, and some other universities. You do not need to set up separate sessions for U.S. and U.K. application consulting. We can cover both systems at once. </p><br>

    <summary><b> How do I go about conducting research as a high school student? </b></summary>
    <p style="margin-left: 25px;"> Conducting research with professors or industry researchers is becoming prominent among high-achieving students, especially those in the tri-state area. Research can signify a studentâ€™s exceptional motivation and ability outside of classes. Elvin and Ethan have experience conducting science research at IBM and UT Austin, and would be delighted to help you reach out to potential mentors. We also keep a list of competitive research programs (including several hidden gems) with tips on how to get in. </p><br>
